# Terraform SageMaker Tutorial
This repo contains a series of modules for working with AWS SageMaker using the HashiCorp Terraform "Infrastructure as Code" tool. The repo is broken down across several "parts" that directly correlate a blog post I wrote and published on Medium. Here are the links to those respective posts as the stand today:

- [Part 1: Terraform Initialization!](https://towardsdatascience.com/terraform-sagemaker-part-1-terraform-initialization-a6470611ea92)
- Part 2: SageMaker Notebook Management! *Coming soon!*
