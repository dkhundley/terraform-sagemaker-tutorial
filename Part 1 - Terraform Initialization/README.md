# Part 1 - Terraform Initialization

This first part is to help get people begin to get acclimated to using Terraform for the first time. As this post serves as a primer for Terraform in general, we do not cover anything actually SageMaker-specific in this particular post.

Here is a list of the Terraform commands we cover in this post:

- `terraform init`
- `terraform plan`
- `terraform apply`
- `terraform destroy`
- `terraform validate`
- `terraform fmt`
